# Noddsdale Readme
Noddsdale is a static blog generator using [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).

### Why build another blog engine?
There are lots of blog engines out there including many that produce a static site from Markdown files.  Noddsdale is a learning exercise for the purpose of building such a generator myself.

### The name noddsdale
The name noddsdale comes from Noddsdale Water, Largs, Ayrshire, Scotland.  I love kayaking, and as a child, I spent a lot of time in Largs as this is my father's hometown, so I decided to reference one of the waterways of my childhood as the name for this project.

## How to use
Currently, noddsdale does not do anything. However, the plan as outlined in [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) is to do the following:

1. Create and change to the root directory of your blog.
2. Initialise a new blog `noddsdale init`.
3. Generate the blog `noddsdale build`.
4. Host the blog locally `noddsdale host`.

## Developer Guide
For information on developing Noddsdale, refere to the [Developer Guide](./docs/developer-guide/README.md)

## Depenencies
I am thankful of the hard work done by others in the community.  In particular noddsdale makes use of:
* [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) 
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
* [YAML](http://yaml.org)
* [Express](http://expressjs.com)

## Roadmap
